Love this app. This app is very helpful and easy to use for younger girl, It tracks your cycle each month, along with any symptoms you experience each day. you can add note each day along with tracking weight and temperature during your cycle. The app reminds you days before you cycle start so you can be prepared. I have been using this for 8 years my daughter use it and so does my sister's and my nieces. I recommend this app to everyone. ,,, POSITIVE
The app is very good, accurate, it helps me thoughtout my cycle to be self aware and manage pms. I have been using it for 4 years now, back then I had given an alternative mail id which isn't working now and there is no option to change the mail id given... So if I happen to log out, all the tracking data for all these years would go. Kindly make it easier to change the mail given as I don't even remember my password and the reset authentication mail will come up on the mail id I can't access. ,,, POSITIVE
Accurate. ,,, POSITIVE
Great ,,, POSITIVE
Good ,,, POSITIVE
It's hard to track irregular cycles because your only "alllowed" to be on for a certain number of days but sometimes my cycle break thru close together and I start a new cycle as soon as the old one terminates. Yes this is not normal, I know that's why i want to track it.. ,,, NEUTRAL
I had irregular periods....and it always used to strike out of the blueüòÇ Thanks to this app I started taking care of myself...(tracking my mood,food....) and now Maya predicts my periods perfectly..(like the exact day) It took awhile(I think like a year) for the app to understand me...but now it's perfect.Love it‚ô•Ô∏è ,,, POSITIVE
This app is ok but personally a simple period tracking app is not something i want to pay a subscription for. The ads have always been fine but now there are constant fullscreen ads which you have to wait to close. i don't mind paying one off for an app but the sub is too expensive. i just need an app where it will tell me what day my period is coming. nothing extra/special. wish they would release a free/lite version ,,, NEGATIVE
I Love it!‚ù§Ô∏è ,,, POSITIVE
I love it! It's so useful. I just wish there were more mood and symptoms options.But, it's still great! ,,, POSITIVE
it helps me a lot! ,,, POSITIVE
They are right on better than a lot of apps ,,, NEUTRAL
It's good if you are consistent in logging or have normal periods. I loved this app. I chose it over 3 others I installed and tried. It is simple and easy to use but apparently if you aren't consistent it just assumes you have a period and if you uninstall it it erases your data so there's no point in signing in. ,,, NEGATIVE
i am unable to install the app....everytime error comes stating cant install the app ,,, NEGATIVE
I LOVE the Maya app and I recommend it to all my friends! It helps me understand and track my cycles and understand why and anticipate when I will be feeling a certain type of way emotionally! It helps me avoid unprotected sex when I am fertile and also helps me know when my period is expected and when I might be late so that I know to take a pregnancy test. It is so critical to a woman's health to know her cycles which is why I love this app so much! I've been using it for over 5 years! ,,, POSITIVE

It helps me to remember my last period. Very helpful. ,,, POSITIVE
its a very calm and cute type of app.. ,,, POSITIVE
Very helpful!!!!! ,,, POSITIVE
Had some trouble with the widget lately but managed to resolve it by deleting it and placing a new one. Don't love some of the directions the app has gone in over the years I've used it, but it's still the only one that gives me such a simple, discreet countdown on my home screen, and that's really all I do with it. ,,, POSITIVE
My experience is good. This app shows correct prediction and need more improvement in features in this app for premium version like ultra manifestation music related to mood during periods for relaxation, medicine advise, exercises etc. Premium year/month plans are reasonable. ,,, POSITIVE
Excellent ,,, POSITIVE
This in one of the best apps to you know your cycle. It's cute and with a lot of options for describe how you are feeling and know yourself . Download it! ,,, POSITIVE

Maya app was recommended to me from my friend. It does really helpful especially on tracking my period whenever I'm delayed or not. It has also other features like predictions and symptoms which helps me alot to be aware on my menstruation. ,,, POSITIVE
I like the app. Been using since 7 years. I have a recommendation: During the days close to periods, women observe increased hairloss. This is due to sudden drop in iron during the luetal phase. It would be great if Maya included that symptom during the PMS. It just makes tracking even more accurate. ,,, POSITIVE

I have been using this all since years. I did a factory reset and got logged out. Now I don't remember the password and forgot password tab is not sending me anything ti my mail ID which is attached to the account. I have mailed on help@mayalive twice and tweeted too. I haven't received a single response yet. Dissappointed with this. A simple thing like resetting of password just seems impossible now. ,,, NEGATIVE

After only a few months of inputting data, the app began giving very accurate hints and predictions about my cycle: symptoms, start dates, cycle length, fertility...I would be lost without this app now! It has also been very useful to use as a record for spotting patterns in symptoms, such as pre-menstrual migraines, and regularity of cycles. ,,, POSITIVE
Good ,,, POSITIVE
I like the simplicity of this app and that it works eventhough I am offline! I have been using this for nore than a year to record my period.

This app is so handy to keep track of period, ovulation, any particular feelings and moods are prompted with a list of options to choose from, and adding in notes is really helpful.

I've been using this app premium since 2013. Never had a problem. Even the times where my cycle was a bit short or a couple of days over, even when my cycles changes after pregnancy, it's still accurate. But I just noticed in charts, the key map says there should be a pink dot for pregnancy. How do I mark "pregnant" instead of "not tracking"? ,,, POSITIVE

Doesn't like the interface. ,,, NEGATIVE
I use since 2017, and I like. But there are no updates, it's just always the same. Wish it could be more dynamic like "Clue", and have more traking options. I don't wanna change apps cuz i track my entire sex life and pill on Maya, but i don't know if i gonna be able to keep using this app since there are a bunch of better ones. ,,, NEUTRAL
I had been using Maya for many years now. Very easy app to navigate , helpful and educational. Love it ,,, POSITIVE
I love it ,,, POSITIVE
Great app ,,, POSITIVE
Very useful for girls. Not only They're able to make a pre-planning for upcomming periods cycle...but also for knowing the pregnancy arrival. Always stay safe and healthy üíñ ,,, POSITIVE
Only reason I'm not switching is I have a long history with the app - changed to 1 star review because of the unnecessary and ridiculous gendered language in the new "Tips" section. Honestly getting rid of that whole feature would be an improvement, it's basically just cringey, outdated gendered stereotypes anyways. Who wrote that and why?! ,,, NEGATIVE
it doesnt track my days well thats the only problem thats why i give it 4 not 5 starsüòó ,,, POSITIVE
The biggest app!! ,,, POSITIVE
I used to loved now I can't even install. I don't know what happened. Could you please help me to solve this? ,,, NEGATIVE

User friendly ,,, POSITIVE
Kinda good ,,, POSITIVE
This is actually a good period tracker with an engaging UI. It doesn't shove pregnancy info in my face... However, the language isn't trans-friendly either so I cannot rate it any higher than I have. Not everyone who menstruates is a woman. Even the little icons for moods, while pretty, are blatantly feminine. ,,, NEUTRAL
I've been using Maya since 2016 and it's the best (and prettiest) period tracking app I've seen. Love it. ,,, POSITIVE
Nice app... ,,, POSITIVE

Gteat ,,, POSITIVE
It's been a great journey so far ,,, POSITIVE
Loved the app. It's so convenient. ,,, POSITIVE
Very simple and easy, also only has necessary tracking + a community to consult about short, quick questions ;) Might get a little frustrating if your period cycle length (regularly) exceeds 45 days as those long cycles are not put in the calculation of your average cycle length (and not graphed in the overview) - would like to see that changed. Otherwise still very happy after over a year of using it. :) ,,, POSITIVE

I love it!!! Great experience so far. ,,, POSITIVE
Aesthetics are too girly and there is far too much data on one page. Just because we are girls and women doesn't mean we want floaty ultra femme visuals and fonts. Nothing against it but it can't be the only option. Can we have some masculine themes please and neat fonts? Also simple backgrounds with solid blocks of colour not crafty. Lastly can everything be smaller and neater with less info on the initial page? It's very overwhelming when you open it up. ,,, NEGATIVE
Very good ,,, POSITIVE
Its a very good app for every woman ,,, POSITIVE

I'm still getting used to it but it is great so far. I used to use Eve, which is great as well don't get me wrong, but they shove premium down your throat. Maya has all of Eve's features, except the quizzes. I can see ads and premium but not intrusively. üòçüëçüèæ ,,, POSITIVE
I have been using this app for more than 3 years now. I recently changed my mobile and do not remember the password and unable to login into the account.

App era muito bom, por√©m ao clicar para encerrar o ciclo e confirmar a data, o App n√£o marca o encerramento e fica registrando como dias de ciclo. Por favor corrijam esse bug urgentemente.

When the period is a few days late the calendar doesn't recalibrate - meaning that it will eventually start listing your next period way too early. Apparently I am starting this month on day 23/28 which has never happened in my life. This is a huge inconvenience and defeats the point of using an app if I have to count manually. ,,, NEUTRAL

I can never get the app to remind me to take my birth control, it does remind me other things but not what I need. Uninstalled it because of this. ,,, NEGATIVE

Very good ,,, POSITIVE
Doesn't allow me to track my period when it's delayed :( ,,, NEUTRAL
The app is really great and I love the asthetic - I've been looking for something like this for some time. It encourages me to use it and stay on top of taking my temp and weighing myself, and recording the measurements. My rating would be 5 stars if it were possible to export or share notes from a specific range of dates to share for health care purposes. I'd also love to see "Silly," "Motivated," "Unmotivated," and "Productive" in the moods/symptoms section as this is helpful for me to track. ,,, POSITIVE

Has really helped me track my cycle and everything that goes with it ,,, POSITIVE
I've been using the free version for about a year. Cute, simple, and clean. I do wish it had a few additional features (eg. pos/neg test result flags, fetal size indicators for the pregnancy tracker, etc.). Otherwise, it's a low key app that leaves you alone but is there when you need it. Just what I like. Subscription is pretty reasonable, and I would probably subscribe if they implemented just a few more features. ,,, POSITIVE
Been using and sticking to this app for years now I really like it. I was thinking tho could you add backpain as a symptom to the list? That would be nice ,,, POSITIVE
So well done ,,, POSITIVE

Its too much useful.. ,,, POSITIVE
I like it so far so good ,,, POSITIVE
Love this app, so simple and easy to use. ,,, POSITIVE
Really great app!! You can earn silver by only sharing it with your friends and collecting a few points which is not that hard. Just the problem is that it does not include certain other moods (one is productive) and also they don't have a section for logging masturbation. Those things could be added and the app could be improved ,,, POSITIVE
Great app very accurate ,,, POSITIVE
Fun to get to know your cycle. ,,, POSITIVE
It is simple and perfect.. really helpful for you to remember your important dates ,,, POSITIVE
I used maya for 2 years but now this application seems doesn't work well..i already sent a report but it's been 2 weeks i've waited..still same..everytime i open this apps,it took 2 - 3 minutes and i only see nothing and all it's black after that the apps can't open and always "stop"_" maya has stop"! PLEASE! PLEASE! ,,, NEGATIVE
Okay this might sound crazy but I think this app has caught up to my trend, knows which day am I going to PMS, and has predicted my dates so accurately this entire year, it's bonkers!! Been using it since 4 years. Highly recommend üëå ,,, POSITIVE

Was great until I started getting spammed with ads. Uninstalled. ,,, NEGATIVE
Excellent! ,,, POSITIVE
Been using this app since 2016, and I rely on it every month. While I do have to admit that I don't use most of its features, this app does what I need it to do. It properly tracks your period and it is very customizable. It usually doesn't get the next period right, but that's okay for me since my periods are very irregular. All in all, a must-have. ,,, POSITIVE
Can't figure out how to change some info ,,, NEUTRAL

Easy to use and track. ,,, POSITIVE
So helpful ,,, POSITIVE
I started using Maya in 2016, I loved the interface it had and how spot on accurate it predicted my period days, and NO ADS. The interface was so simple but it did what I needed it to. It's evolved into something completely different now; it offers a forum and you have to pay for premium. The forum is filled with posts of people asking others if they "missed their period, so" are they now pregnant? This app and users aren't doctors. There shouldn't be a place for questions like this. ,,, NEGATIVE
Such a lovely app with flexible functions to make our period days easy! ,,, POSITIVE
Sells your data to facebook, just like clue does. The intimate details about yourself, such as when you last ovulated or had sex, is sent straight to facebook in order for them to place eyes on you. Another potential sex trafficking scheme. Unfortunate. ,,, NEGATIVE
Very clear and easy to use app. Sends updates of when ur period is due or overdue so u can update it. Very good way to keep track of ur periods also. Think I would b lost without this app now ,,, POSITIVE
Nice and very helpful for those who never remember the dates ,,, POSITIVE

Simple and lovely. Better than most period apps out there. ,,, POSITIVE
Really love this app! Nice aesthetics too ,,, POSITIVE
Excellent üòä ,,, POSITIVE
Overall interface is nice but lacks attention to details. Agreeing with several other reviews, the deal breaker for me was how this app does not allow you to mark the end of longer-than-normal cycles. The app will force it to be marked as the next cycle without asking.. I actually even reported this issue and the customer service just gave a generic response of how improvements are coming. It never did. I've switched to a better app after some googling. ,,, NEGATIVE
Great. Works well. Predictions good ,,, POSITIVE

Works perfect! I am very happy to use it ,,, POSITIVE
Muy buena app, me ha sido bastante √∫til ,,, POSITIVE
Really like this but it needs to be able to sync better with the pill. For some reason it shows my count is wrong when I know for a fact it is not as I've recorded it daily for years now. Also think it should be easier to change count/pill length. For those who are adjusting to different types of the pill it would be good to be able to log the affects it has on you as well as length etc to help find the right pill for you ,,, POSITIVE
Just want to say "Wow" ,,, POSITIVE
Great tracking app. ,,, POSITIVE
Para situaciones en las que tu periodo sea largo, aproximadamente 45 d√≠as, el aplicativo reconoce a ese periodo como si no hubieras ingresado nuevo ciclo, y no te permite hacer un seguimiento real, pues supone que ya pasaron 2 periodos completos cuando no es as√≠. ,,, NEGATIVE

I'm using it since four years.. Period graph is shown for proper calculation. But at times, cycle is shown wrong.. Fertile Phase tracker is helpful, minute body changes regarding peroids are recordable.. Good app ,,, POSITIVE
Perfect app for tracking my irregular cycle due to pcos and endo. Perfect little note section to note how I've been feeling and symptoms etc to keep track of how it's doing. ,,, POSITIVE
App is good, now encountering a bizzare limitation. After last baby born, whenever I'm trying to add a new cycle it starts new pregnancy ü§î. One should have more flexibility to edit start of pregnancy. ,,, NEGATIVE
This is app is really good for tracking my cycle as all as me having notes on my emotions, how my body feels, etc. I think I paid for the subscription so that I could continue to have the information they provide monthly regarding how your body changes during your cycle, but it's the same repetitive info monthly, so I didn't need to do that. ,,, POSITIVE
good ,,, POSITIVE
Almost 100% perfect but is not far off from predictions most times. ,,, POSITIVE

It used to be good but the constant ads are making me want to move to something else.

I love this app not only does it track your next cycle but if you have a question you can always ask us lady's. Love how aesthetic, positive and organized it all is. ,,, POSITIVE

It really helps you track down your periods. I have been using it from past 4 years now... great app. ,,, POSITIVE
I've tried several different cycle apps, but Maya has always been the most organized for me. The only thing I would like added is a larger list of symptoms for cycles. Fatigue, backaches ect. are symptoms that are consistent and worth a option to click on. ,,, POSITIVE
I really love this app so far. The only problem I'm having is that when you first sign up it asks you for a cycle/period length and I didn't know so I gave one which was too short, but now I can't change it and it's saying that my period has ended when it hasn't. I think you need to make that part more flexible as not everyone knows the exact time frame. But other than that the app is perfect. ,,, POSITIVE
Useful app to track your Periods. ,,, POSITIVE
I've been using it for years and it's the best! ,,, POSITIVE
I love this app! I have been using it 6 years now with no complaints! ,,, POSITIVE
I was happy using this app.... but the thing is am bit upset of reading negative terms ... like if this is happening then its cancer, menopause or this that a person get demotivated... unless the person is going through some pain or problems... am trying to conceive and the app keep popping that you have missed the date it's because of sone negative reasons stop giving such updated .... you need to have some some update in the app like ... implantation or easy way to chat or help .. ,,, NEGATIVE

This app is really great! I use it and DOT to have two points of reference for avoiding pregnancy. I only have the free version, but I love the insights and information it offers for where I'm at in my cycle, as well as the predictions for mood and symptoms. If something's happening with my mood or body and I'm not sure why, I now tend to check this app to see if it's expected for whatever point of my cycle I'm in. Overall, it's just helping me be more in tune with my body and moods. ,,, POSITIVE
Amazing and user friendly app, I've been using it for years. I don't know what I'd do without it. ,,, POSITIVE
Amo esse app estou com ele desde 2015. ,,, POSITIVE
Nice tracking app, but now that I'm pregnant, I'm not sure what to do with it: do I just leave it and come back after my period starts again? Will such a gap affect how accurate the data is (will the app think that I just didn't have periods for 10 months?)? It says that it can track pregnancy, but I couldn't find it. ,,, POSITIVE
I've been using this app for years, and it's been with me through multiple phones. It's a great app, except after some recent update the pill notifications stopped popping up, so it now doesn't do one of the only two things I need from it. Hence it's half as useful as it was üò≠ hope it gets fixed soon ,,, NEUTRAL

I like it so far although I wish they had more then 2 options for birth control. They don't have the birth control I am on (Implant) and I feel like it may make the data slightly off. Edit: its not tracking my cycle properly. I have yet to end my cycle myself and it keeps ending it for me. ,,, POSITIVE
I like the app, but how do you expect that any woman describe its symptoms, if there's a restriction of how you can write about your pain...? How is that writing " I'm in a lot of pain and have cold sweat" is inappropriated language? I really wanted to use the forum to meet girls with ny condition but now I don't know how to write my experience ( even when I have read nore detailed stories) ‚òπÔ∏è ,,, NEGATIVE

I've been using this app for about five years and have been fairly happy with it. During my second pregnancy (2017) I had rated the app and suggested they add an area to track pregnancy. After my third pregnancy (2020) I got a notification saying the app added pregnancy stuff, but I haven't checked it out because it was after my pregnancy. I'm here now to suggest they add "clumsy" to their symptoms area of the period tracker. Clumsiness is largely a hormonal symptom for me. ,,, POSITIVE
Using it for the last 3 years and I'm very very less stressed because Maya predictes my monthly flow without any hassle. Thank you. ,,, POSITIVE
It's an amazing app! ,,, POSITIVE
Love this app. Very convenient. ,,, POSITIVE

Great app! ,,, POSITIVE
I've had the app for 3 years and it's perfect! It's feminine without being childish and has never gotten my cycle wrong. It helped me get pregnant and track my pregnancy and is now helping me avoid getting pregnant again. It is the most helpful and simple app I've ever used ,,, POSITIVE

Using it for a while, in general happy about it. the only problem if you have a time when your period is off, the app takes it like you miss to include the info and not a long delay ,,, POSITIVE
Used it for a month and half and it suddenly wouldn't let me log my flow anywhere when my period started, now it says I'm 5 days late meanwhile-- there's no flow chart in the notes anywhere -- looked for help on google - nothing. ,,, NEGATIVE
I've been using this app for years. Now I changed my phone and can't log in again since I forgot my password. When I go Forgot Password it doesn't do anything to help me, it says this account doesn't exist. How can I fix this problem to use this app again? I really like this app. ,,, POSITIVE

Some times I miss pills so therefore I don't record that I've taken them in the app. It would be great if the app could take note that I've missed a pill. Or you can restart the count from 1 to 21 because it won't remind you take the pill if it's counting too early. ,,, NEUTRAL

I'd give it 5 stars if I had the ability to view the "today's tip" for all the past days that I've tracked, okay not all but at least the current month and the last week of the month prior when enter a new month.

I like this app but there is only one thing that I don't like, the notes.

Fantastic interface. Very useful app. ,,, POSITIVE
I like how much information you can input and the cycle graph. I wish there were graphs on your mood and symptom changes though out your cycle. The cycle predictions have also not been accurate so far. I've tracked 6 cycles and it still tells me to expect my cycle a week late each month. Maybe it's from my second one logged having been abnormally long, but all the rest have been between 29-33 days so it's odd. The link to contact the developers has been disabled. ,,, NEUTRAL

My favoirite app for personal track keeping. But I forgot my password and cannot reset it now. They say password has been sent to email but I receive nothing. Guess I'll have to uninstall it if it doesn't get back to normal. ,,, NEGATIVE
I've been using this app for a couple of years now. It has taught me so much. Especially about how my body works and reacts to the monthly changes us women go through. This makes me better prepared, in advance, to tackle everything headed my way. Be it PMS or the cycle itself. Its a great app. It takes time to collect data and understand your patterns. Be patient and it will help you in the long run. ,,, POSITIVE
This is one of a kind. Only problem is that I had a gap period of 55 days, the which the app doesn't record. It goes in the 'Not tracking' more. Hence, one star less. ,,, POSITIVE
This is literally the best period/ovulation tracker Ive ever experienced using! Its free and easy to use.

I was a huge advocate of this app, ever since their beta 8yrs ago. I used it regularly & was glad to pay for a subscription. Even referred people! However, with company growth, rates & I was not grandfathered into a "premium" account. Then the addition of a confusing & unhelpful forum really changed the user interface in the app. Then, there were ads for every new screen. Between sharing personal data & supporting political campaign ads, it's impossible to continue supporting this app. I tried. ,,, NEGATIVE
It made my period tracking very easy, one of the best app. They 90% make correct prediction of my next cycle. A go to app. ,,, POSITIVE

The best cycle app I have come across. I love how cute it is and there are so many options to accurately describe your cycle and how you are feeling. I signed up for the 1 year subscription for $4.99 I don't like to spend money on apps but it is well worth it! The only downside is if my cycle ran longer than expected by a day it won't let me change the end date. ,,, POSITIVE
I love this app! I've been using this app to track my period and my mood swings in med school and it has been very helpful in understanding why i feel lazy or why am i cranky, for example, in some days. This is the best app, personally, for tracking periods, emotions, and symptoms. :) ,,, POSITIVE
Been using this app since 2012. Really easy to use and keep track of periods. Love that I can see trends over time, and there's a lot of features without upgrading to premium. Looks cute too, and soft on the eyes. I've also lost phone data several times, but being able to back it up for free has been immensely useful. Dark mode would be cool to add though ,,, POSITIVE

Not great. I got this app when it was my first period and i put that my average was 4 days because I had no idea. Ended up lasting a whole 7 days without being able to log in anything other than the first 4 days. I couldn't work out how to change the average or anything. I like the little paragraph tips it gives every day, but please change the average problem! ,,, NEUTRAL

Been using this app for 8 years now. Every time I change my phone, this is one of the things that I first download. I use this to track my period. Although the predictions aren't 100% accurate, it's enough for estimations. Thanks to this, I am always prepared whenever I'll have my period. The app is user friendly too plus I like the additional features very much. It also notes when you're not tracking anymore. ,,, POSITIVE

Very useful app, easy to use and with interesting tips ,,, POSITIVE
It ONLY has the ability to average all data. So it isn't smart, and doesn't adjust to changes over time, which naturally happen with age. I deleted years of data in order to get prediction that is accurate. I have diligently recorded the stop & start for years. The problem is the app's inability to adjust to trends. The longer I use the app, the more inaccurate it becomes. ,,, NEGATIVE
It would be great if you give reminders for the notes I've put since I don't check it daily. thanks. Edited: been using Maya for over 2 years now and its perfect ‚ô•Ô∏è ,,, POSITIVE

The average gets stuck at 36 days Edit: I've only had 28 day cycle for more than 4 months of using the app. The average still showed 36. I relied on this app to give me a notification on probable date. You let me down. Fix it. Please. It was a wonderful app otherwise and I'll take the one star down. Edit 2: I said, I did. ,,, NEGATIVE
Good for period tracking - not fertility. You can't change projected or actual ovulation dates, it gives you the fertile dates and suspected ovulation date and doesn't consider that it can change. I prefer the easy@home app for my OPK strips and ovulation tracking. I'm trying to get pregnant. I do know my exact ovulation because I test with strips.. you do and can know the day per testing. ,,, NEUTRAL

Indispensable! 2020-6-15: Any chance you could add an option for a specific person to get the PMS warning via text message? Or is that a premium feature? 2018-6-1: Hey! Perhaps you could add a checkbox for me to say I am peri-menopausal so the menstruation stops tracking, and I can still track other symptoms and such...? Or do you have a menopause app? Perhaps you could add a "symptom" icon for ovulation pain?) ,,, POSITIVE

I like this app but I would like it a lot better if the app was inclusive of the diversity of people with periods. As a gay woman I didn't resonate with a lot of the messaging--felt coded for straight people.

I love this app I have between using it for fertility awareness for 2 years and it is SO helpful to keep me on top of my cycle and knowing when is safe to have sex and when is not. I also love being able to look back at the graph of my cycles over the years and see how they fluctuate and the range of days (my longest/shortest cycles) over time. So grateful to have this tool to keep track of my moontime. Thanks Maya! ,,, POSITIVE

Ive been using Maya for a few months niw and to be completely honest, this app is probably obe of the best for young women who just want to track their periods and moods and symptoms. Maya has helped me at a time where my periods got super irregular and I was still able to track them well. The tips and information provided along the sides are also super fun and useful to read! Please give maya a try for at least e periods before you decide if she's right for you! ,,, POSITIVE

Notifications don't work. It's an ok app other than that but my first start of cycle with it I relied on it notifying me when I was due to start and it didn't, meaning I was left caught out without any period products which isn't something that's happened to me since I was a teen. All my phone and app settings are set to receive notifications, yet I'm just not getting them and it's the one reason I'm even using the app. ,,, NEGATIVE

Maya is really bad, now wants to charge for a human necesity which is menstruation. Are you going to charge it as the tampons and other female products so they are as expensive too??? HELL NO GIRL!!!

You can also go old school and use paper and pen but I'll personally recommend to get an iPad for a bit of less pollution. ,,, NEGATIVE

I have been using this app for years now. I chose it because of the design and I love it since that. It has all the necessary features but nothing more and it is a good thing. A period tracker shouldn't be overcomplicated anyway. One thing I don't like is that the advertisements in this app don't follow the general settings of my phone which means that even if my phone is in silent mode they are with sound and scare me to death when they turn up. So I can only use it at home. ,,, POSITIVE

Great for tracking my period BUT my pwriod is every 33-35 days, I can't change that in the app and it hasn't adjusted during the three years I've used it. ,,, NEGATIVE
For those who need simple tracking app. No dietary drama, no fancy interface, no crazy number of theme that takes up spaces. This app exit in ur phone just sittin there silently waitin in case u need it. Tracking is accurate and u have option to add notes for each day. Loves it. Been using for years. Hope it'll NOT change much or ill unsubs. Just stay simple, k. (Update : ABSOLUTELY HATE the newest "conversation" update. Lucky i didnt auto-update. If the app force me to update, ill unsubs!!!!) ,,, POSITIVE
It has different information on different days which is cool cuz it tells u about your body n what to do n etc n u can tell everyone your problems ,,, POSITIVE

this is a great period tracker app, with a nice interface and great functionality over all. i'm not giving it the 5 stars due to some bugs regarding the pill reminder. for some reason sometimes it is trigger and others it is not -- i had to set a regular reminder set on daily for my pill reminders. apart from that is great. ,,, POSITIVE

This is a comprehensive app with more thoughtful content that lets me consider my cycle wholesomely. Features are designed well. I'd request that the symptoms or emotions could be chosen with our own labels, ie we could create our own labels to go with the logo/emoji icons for various physical symptoms or emotions/moods. Each of us have our own recognizable recurring symptoms and reactions that would be nice to record to actually learn more about our individual selves as the app encourages. ,,, POSITIVE

But when you set up your account it gives you the option to choose why you want to use the app and I think it would be helpful if you could select more than one. For example I'd like it if I could use it to try and avoid pregnancy as well as tracking my period. ,,, POSITIVE
Very useful. The appearance of the app is so cute!.. thank you! ,,, POSITIVE

Amazing app. Symptoms and moods are accurate, easy layout. My fav part is where you can tell others about your problem and other people can help u! Amazing! Absolutely love this app and would most definitely recommend. ,,, POSITIVE
I've found Maya really useful, and accurate when it comes to predictions of mood and symptoms. I particularly like the widgit countdown to your next period. The only thing I would say is that you only have the option of "unprotected" or "protected" when you record sex, rather than more specific e.g. "hormone contraception", "barrier contraception", "withdrawal", "none" which I have come across in other apps. ,,, POSITIVE
I have been using Maya since 2013 when it was known as LoveCycles. The more you use it, the more Maya gets to know you. The app is still very accurate at predicting when my cycle will start since I'm fairly regular. Something else I have always loved is how discreet this app is. It does not look like someone tried too hard to glamourize and sparkle up my period. I feel no dread opening up this app anywhere in public because it looks like a regular calendar. ,,, POSITIVE
This is an excellent app. Keep it up with your work! ,,, POSITIVE
I love it!!! ,,, POSITIVE

So handy to track my periods and I like the info they provide about my cycle ,,, POSITIVE
Me sirvi√≥ hasta el momento en que tuve un ciclo de 21 dias. No lo registr√≥ dej√≥ todo en gris y no lo cuenta en las estad√≠sticas. Cuando lo reporte me respondieron "esta grabado". Lamentablemente la aplicaci√≥n solo sirve si tenes un ciclo regular y bien portado. Si llegas a tener un desfase hormonal o decid√≠s acortar tu ciclo con hormonas la app NO TE VA A SERVIR. me arrepiento de pagar la suscripci√≥n. Me molest√≥ mucho la respuesta que me dieron. YA ME PUSE EN CONTACTO y no vali√≥ la pena. ,,, NEGATIVE
The best app ever ,,, POSITIVE

Too good ,,, POSITIVE
i enjoyed using Maya and more than happy to pay for it once for all. But the monthly/yearly payment plan is bit werid for an app that only has one main function, which is tracking periods. If its like the ADOBE suite, which needs to add on new features every month, then it will make more sense to pay monthly. In this case, paying yearly or monthly to a simple function app is only a money game. I'm waiting for the day that when Maya realised this, and set up a one off price for the product. ,,, POSITIVE
Awesome calculation.. liked the app overall ,,, POSITIVE
Great App. Does exactly what you want it to and it's very, very accurate. I've used it now for well over a year and I very highly recommend it. Edit: I've now used this app for 2 years and it predicts correctly down to the day now and I could not reccomend it more highly. ,,, POSITIVE

I don't usually write reviews for apps, but for this app I'll make an exception! I've tried a few period tracking apps before and none of them compares to Maya. It has become a habit to check the app just to read the Today's Tip. I absolutely LOVE that it explains so well what I'm going through at the moment. You guys are awesome for making this app! ,,, POSITIVE
Grateful to have this app. Good on tips ok ,,, POSITIVE
Too good ,,, POSITIVE
Amazing! ,,, POSITIVE
My response to developers' response: Thank you very much for your response. I knew these processes of correction. I am warning people of possible human error, it was not error of the app. üôÇ Thank you for putting out this app with abundant free of cost features. For the users, be very careful while marking period start & end dates. Otherwise 1 or more mistakes and you could be accessing your period/pregnancy in this app with wrong signs symptoms hence you may end up in major Jeopardy. Thanks.. ,,, POSITIVE
Very nice but is not as easy as de other Aap ,,, NEUTRAL
This app potentially feeds our data to FB according to article. Been using for years but because of this have to uninstall just to be safe. ,,, NEGATIVE

It helps me keep track of my days. For me the app is very accurate. ,,, POSITIVE
Th study, 'No Body's Business But Mine: How Menstruation Apps Are Sharing Your Data' reveals that out of the few studied-apps with a wide user-reach, two of them, Maya by Plackal Tech and MIA by Mobapp Development have appeared to extensively share highly personal data with Facebook to target audience for advertisers. ,,, NEGATIVE
I cannot believe that you guys leaked informations on your users and did not even have the decency to send us a e-mail concerning that matter. ,,, NEGATIVE
Love the daily tips, helps me understand my moods better and my body ,,, POSITIVE

Recently found out that the App shares data with Facebook without the users knowledge. ,,, NEGATIVE
I have read on internetMaya is sharing our personal data with Facebook. Is this news is true? ,,, POSITIVE
Data sharing with Facebook is absolutely not acceptable. It is a breach in privacy, even if you have this clause in you privacy policy, it should b mentioned were users actually read it. ,,, NEGATIVE
Data leakage is highly unacceptable and horrifying!! Uninstalled!!! ,,, NEGATIVE
Read in an article about how maya and other apps share personal details with Facebook..if that has been dealt with i would reinstall it, otherwise I have been using it since 2016 with no complaints ,,, NEUTRAL
The app shares your private data to FB and other third party apps. There's even an article in the ET on the same. Don't use the app. ,,, NEGATIVE
Used to love this app, but now it's laden with ads. I also just found out it shares my data with third parties, including Facebook. What used to be a wonderful tool to empower women to track their health, has become a money-hungry cash cow. ,,, NEGATIVE
Look, I love Maya, but the fact that you sell our data in aggregate or no without having us opt into FB sales is appalling. ,,, NEGATIVE
Very useful ,,, POSITIVE
Heard that data is leaked. Is it so? ,,, NEGATIVE
UNINSTALL AND DONT INSTALL. MAYA IS SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFO WITH FACEBOOK. I've had this app for years but now leaving after the release of article being shared that maya has release ovulation, period, personal information like when you had sex. They released and shared the emotions they ask you to fill in. Dont get it. I deleted my profile. ,,, NEGATIVE
It's great ,,, POSITIVE
If you want to use this app you have to agree to have your data shared with third party apps like Facebook. Really? ,,, NEGATIVE
I really like the interface of this app..very soothing and cool..It would have been wonderful if the azure theme wasn't a paid feature.. ,,, POSITIVE
recommended to all women I know, it is very accurate and helps me understand what is going on ,,, POSITIVE
Sharing cycle info, among other info, with Facebook? Disgusting. If this is true, then get rid of the annoying ads that blast sound without my consent, even when my volume is off. ,,, NEGATIVE
Very complete and easy to keep a track. ,,, POSITIVE
They'll share your personal data with Facebook and other 3rd party apps, mind how much you share ,,, NEGATIVE

Best thing abt this app is that, the record it maintains helps me gather any data required to show a consultant even wen I change multiple phones. I've been using this app for 5 years and I'm very happy abt the features. It shows a graph of my cycle past these years(it's cool right?) and mood predictions to be prepared. I took 5 long years to post good comment abt this app . it's worth a shot to try for those who are health and hygiene conscious .I bet itll help u in the future like it did for me ,,, POSITIVE

The app used to be great, I downloaded it in 2014 and it made my life so much easier. After years of loyal use I will be deleting it due to the new update that forces you to go premium to avoid pop up ads whenever you click anything. Shame on the developers. Edit: I am not condemning the use of ads as I know they are necessary, I am condemning the abuse of them. For every touch there is an ad. Every single one. It feels like I just opened a spam window. Like hell I will keep supporting it. ,,, NEGATIVE
useful enough to track periods ,,, POSITIVE
Great menstrual and *health* app. Keep track of your cycle, weight fluctuations, moods, pms symptoms, intimacy, temperature and more for a good overall picture of how your body responds to and what you can expect with monthly hormonal changes.

This hasn't been totally accurate with my ovulation days since having my son (breastfeeding/irregular cycles). I anticipate it'll get back on track after my cycles become more normal again. I'd also like a way to change a setting for birth control type. My husband and I use NFP so I select "Unprotected" when logging every "Love" event but wish I could just set it once since I never intend to use protection. The pregnancy mode is also a bit lacking but there are other apps for that. Thanks! :) ,,, POSITIVE

i am a week person with dates and i always forget the last periods date. this app saved my life. ,,, POSITIVE
Was a good app, but not being able to record flow for more than seven days made it impossible for me to accurately record my cycle. When that was raised with the developer they ignored it, and pretended they didn't understand other feedback (yet their English here seems fluent). The recent update demanding an annual subscription to get rid of ads that play audio makes it unusable. Am looking for a replacement. ,,, NEGATIVE
Good app overall but for people suffering with menstrual problems, the flow dates need to be extended or custom. It will be easier for us to keep a track. ,,, NEUTRAL
